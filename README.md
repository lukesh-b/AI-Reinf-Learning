# AI-Reinf-Learning

```yaml
Reinforcement Learning — it's about learning from actions and the feedback we get from the environment to improve over time.
Similar to how we humans learn: you know that  if you score a goal in football, you know you will be rewarded with a point.
And, the more points you get, the better you are doing !!

Let’s teach machines how to learn.
Let’s begin the journey !!!

I am still working on my private repo to try and bring some of it after testing in my public repo
